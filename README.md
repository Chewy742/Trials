# Dungeon-Trials

A personal project that showcases my first foray into Game Development and Unity, this 2D Dungeon game highlights different monsters and collectables. 

Read the Game Rules file for a detailed description of in-game monsters or rules, or jump right in to figure things out for yourself. 

Currently has 2 levels, and a 3rd unfinished level. 

To play the game, you can download the repository and click on the dated application to run the game. 

Scripts for the game can be found in the Assets folder.
